# react-to-webcomponent-modal-management

-----

This is a quick proof of concept on how to manage React Web Components props from outside the WebComponent using `react-to-webcomponent` library. It's a two way control, using the `document` API in order to show or hide a modal.

The whole control on showing and hiding the modal could also be added in the html `script` tag. The same works for adding the whole control inside the component, when it's built. To be honest, I don't know yet what's the best approach to solve this problem, but works fine.

I was not able to find a lot of examples on the web. I'm leaving it on github so others can be helped!
